🤟 Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition System
Welcome to the Real-Time Hand Gesture Recognition project! This cutting-edge AI application detects hand gestures either from your webcam live feed or from uploaded images — all powered by deep learning and computer vision.

🚀 Features
Live Webcam Gesture Detection: Capture and recognize gestures in real-time using your camera.

Image Upload Support: Upload any hand gesture image and get instant predictions.

Multi-Class Recognition: Recognizes 10+ different hand gestures with high accuracy.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive UI to make testing easy and fun.

Optimized Deep Learning Model: Lightweight and efficient TensorFlow model for fast inference.

🎯 Why This Project?
Hand gestures are a natural and intuitive way to communicate with machines. This project brings AI and computer vision together to build a practical, responsive gesture recognition system that can be used in:

Sign language translation

Touchless device control

Interactive gaming

Accessibility tools for differently-abled users
